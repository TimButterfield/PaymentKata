# Payment Processing Kata

1. IMPORTANT. There are two branches. I've left main as the orignial version and branched off to keep both versions: See https://github.com/TimButterfield/PaymentKata/tree/refactored-version for the refactored version. See https://github.com/TimButterfield/PaymentKata/pull/1 for a diff perspective.
2. I'm sure there are various other improvements to be made, but I believe I've improved the code, driving from tests along the way
3. I'm curious about the coverage. I used Rider, which for some reason isn't giving me the chance to run dotcover. I'm sure I can improve the coverage further. 
4. There appears to be a bug in the code. I'm keen to discuss this as it seems like an odd choice in behaviour. 

Hopefully I'll get a chance to discuss the code / pair.
